    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Concerning web security: It is strongly advised to stay updated on the current security threats, exploits, and malware on the web.
      This can be done by referring to the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) list, at https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/.
      
      The HTTPS protocol would be highly suggested to prevent vulnerability and for the sake of your client's safety. HTTPS offer encryption that benefits the client and their sensitive data.
      
      Furthermore, adding a two-factor security authenticator, gives the client a higher level of safety, when interacting with your site.
      
      Also, be aware of vulnerabilities as a result of malicious scripts, such as SQL injections, where queries are used to inject scripts that give the attacker access to sensitive data. It is advised to be waryÂ of any URL you come across. Use the sanitize function before interacting with the URL(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Sanitizer/sanitize).
      This function removes any malicious code associated with the URL.
      Some websites and online resources offer security scans on websites such as https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/website-scanner.
      
      Test often for vulnerability issues, to maintain a high-security standard, involve the entire team, and make sure that everyone is up to date on the OWASP list.
